# ML_StudentGrades
Machine Learning Project on Student Grades

## 1° Understand the Data Base
Look at the variables correlations and the target variable (Final Grade - G3)

## 2° Build a Regression Model
Use the variables selected from step 1 and develop a model with machine learning.

## 3° Understand the Data Base
Use only Grades G1 and G2 to predict Final Grade G3 and compare the results with the Model from step 2.
